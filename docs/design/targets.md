1. Define and Refine Your Requirements

Write a detailed list of features you want to implement, prioritizing the core ones (adaptive scheduling, skill prioritization, habit tracking, and integration with tools like Notion and Google Calendar).
Break down the project into milestones, such as design, development, testing, and integration, so you have a clear roadmap to follow.

2. UI/UX Design
Start sketching low-fidelity wireframes for your app. Focus on key screens like the dashboard, skill prioritization, and notifications.
Use a tool like Figma or Adobe XD to create early wireframes.
Define the user journey: How will users interact with the app? What steps do they take to prioritize skills or schedule study sessions?


5. Research Algorithms for Spaced Repetition
Study algorithms for spaced repetition and how they are implemented (e.g., Anki's or SuperMemo’s approach).
Begin drafting how the forgetting curve and adaptive scheduling will function in your app (e.g., when a user needs to review certain skills or topics).

Establish a version control workflow (e.g., Git flow) to manage different development stages.

8. Documentation

Start keeping notes about your progress, decisions, and challenges so you can easily build out your final report later.
Document each decision related to technical stacks, design choices, and integration strategies.

Suggested Initial Focus:

Design and research: Get your UI/UX ideas down in wireframes and user flows.

Backend basics: Set up the groundwork for authentication, skill tracking, and habit management.

Integration research: Understand how external tools will fit into your system.

By focusing on these tasks, you’ll create a strong foundation for your project, making it easier to build out the rest over time.
